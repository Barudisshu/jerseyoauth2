h1. JerseyOAuth2

Did you ever want to offer OAuth2 for your (Jersey) REST service? Did you hold back, because there
was no server framework available for Jersey? Now here is the solution... 

h2. OAuth2 Provider for Jersey

It uses 
* Jersey 1.17
* Guice 3.0
* Apache Amber 0.22 

to implement the OAuth2 functionality. This project
aims to support "OAuth2 draft 31":http://tools.ietf.org/html/ietf-oauth-v2-31.

**THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, SO DON'T USE IN PRODUCTION.**
